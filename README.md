## Plant Disease Detection Model with Inceptionv3 Architecture for Object Recognition of Disease Plant

Inception-v3 is a convolutional neural network that is 48 layers deep with Inception block.

## Steps

1) Train the model (pd.ipynb) using Colaboratory which offers Free Gpu for Training.
2) save the model with .h5 extension
3) Import plantdiseasedetection SQL file in Mysql using Xamp server

## Run
1) Install the required Packages
                      
             pip install -r requirements.txt

2) change Host IP address in app.py file

3) Run python file                    
             
             python app.py
